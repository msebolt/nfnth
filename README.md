### On Deed to Domain

Explore [UR.Land](https://ur.land), the [Land of Dralun](https://dralun.com), inspired by the legendary sword of [Durendal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durendal), an **Ethereum**-powered world designed around the concept of *deeds*, *domains*, and *artifacts*.

- Create the ultimate domain with links to your personal profile
- Store, collect, and share artifacts (with private key-based option)
- View real-time stats on [UStat.us](https://ustat.us) dashboard





To begin, [visit us on OpenSea](https://opensea.io), or [wander the world](https://dralun.com) as **Nomad** *(note that access to [UR.Land]() requires [MetaMask]())*.

### On Domains and Artifacts

Dralun uses the concept of the *domain deed*, a **NFT** used to provide ownership, access to a domain, and control over a domain's artifacts. Upon transfer of the NFT, all ownership, access, and artifacts, are also transferred.  

The *domain deed* grants control over both the access and content, to allow,

- access to domain properties
- access to domain artifacts (both *public* and *private*)
- ability to create, edit, and share artifacts (both *public* and *private*)

Note that when the NFT is transferred, all rights granted to the previous owner are revoked.



The *domain deed (NFT)* includes,

- rights to access the domain
- rights to the NFT properties
  - stock image
  - map icon, placement, and profile
  - link to historical record
- rights to the domain artifacts (accessed on [UR.Land](https://ur.land))

Custom NFTs are minted per user as *proof of purchase* to be recorded in the [deed registry]().

#### Domain Collections

The primary set of **domain deeds** listed on [UR.Land](https://ur.land) is limited to 1776 in the spirit of *.us* and to preserve fair trade value. 

An additional 776 **domain deeds** are reserved as limited edition to celebrate [Roland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland), in honor of [dralun]().

Time-locked objects and standard art-based are excluded from these limitations. 

|Collection|example|description|
|-|-|-|
|[Lands]()|[acebasin.us]()||
|[People](), [tribes]()|[arikawa.us]()||
|[Machines](), [relics]()|[zanos.us]()||
|[Time-locked objects]()| the [Gunslinger]()||
|[Artwork]()|[Chimi mascot]()||

#### Domain Types and Labels

Types and labels are used to differentiate and classify domains. Deeds also use labels to denote properties such as state, serial, and informational links.

|**Type**|Categories|Labels|
|-|-|-|
|**Person**|historical, tribe||
|**Place**|land, town, mountain, river, island, monument||
|**Thing**|ancient, machine||
|**Object**|||
|**Artwork**|||

#### Artifacts

Artifacts are records (text, image/file, location) posted to a domain. 

Public artifacts can be viewed by everyone, private artifacts can only be viewed by the domain holder or with key. 

Use the [editor]() for an example. 

Domain space is limited to 1GB (*subject to change*).
