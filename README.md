### On Deed to Domain

**Dralun** is the concept of *domain deed*, control over both access and content.

This can be used to mean one of the following:

- access to name records, subject to a formal registrar of ICAHNN (as typically used) (requires permanent transfer)
- access to digital property associated to domain (similar to copyright license)
- (both) access to control and access to source

Thus a need for *domain deed* to become the representation of both control and content, the said **source** of a digital property.

Dralun uses classes to differentiate, and domains can be permenently transferred, depending on the need.

#### Deed Types
