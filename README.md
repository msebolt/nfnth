### On Deed to Domain

Explore [UR.Land](https://ur.land), the [Land of Dralun](https://dralun.com), inspired by the legendary sword of [Durendal](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Durendal), an **Ethereum**-powered world designed around the concept of *deeds*, *domains*, and *artifacts*.

- Create the ultimate domain with links to your personal profile
- Store, collect, and share artifacts (with private key-based option)
- View real-time stats on [UStat.us](https://ustat.us) dashboard

To begin, [visit us on OpenSea](https://opensea.io/NfNth), or [wander the world](https://dralun.com) as **Nomad**, *note that access to UR.Land requires [MetaMask]()*.

### On Domains

Dralun uses the concept of the *domain deed*, a **NFT** used to provide ownership, access to a domain, and control over a domain's artifacts. Upon transfer of the NFT, all ownership, access, and artifacts, are also transferred.  

The *domain deed* grants control over both the access and content, to allow,

- access to domain properties
- access to domain artifacts (both *public* and *private*)
- ability to create, edit, and share artifacts (both *public* and *private*)

Note that when the NFT is transferred, all rights granted to the previous owner are revoked.

Custom NFTs are minted per user as *proof of purchase* to be recorded in the [deed registry](https://nfnth.github.io/nfnth/src/manifest).

#### Collections

The primary set of **UR.Land** domains is limited to `1776` in spirit of *.us* and to preserve fair trade value. 

An additional set `776` **Tribes of Dralun** are reserved in honor of [Roland](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland).
