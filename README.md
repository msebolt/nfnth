## On [Dralun](https://dralun.com), Land of Deed to Domain

**Dralun** is the built upon the need to preserve artifacts of the people with deeds etched in code.



Nomad and Civilian deeds are domain non-specific and are used to extend UR.Land functionality,

Nomads, Create and post artifiacts

- Civilians, Run scenarios "Live" (and vote) withen any domain (Civilian only)
- Tenants, control over content only
- Owner, control over access and content

Some notable features, include:

  - [purchase]() as **Owner**, [claim]() as **Tenant**, or [proceed]() as **Civilian**
  - view public records (with historical context) of all purchases, forfeiture, and transfer
- use of the **Markre** editor, see [nfnth.com](https://nfnth.com), with tools to,
  - Create *artifacts* (includes text, image, location)
  - Create *profiles* (in MarkDown 2.0) for user and domains with MarkDown 2.0 constructs, such as treaty and strategy
- instruction for the **Jaspre** engine, to setup a custom domain,
  - Run the **brOS** build script, see [gist]()

To begin, [sign in]() (or [create an account]()), to recieve a user badge with **Nomad** status.

### On Deed to Domain

**Dralun** is the concept of the *domain deed*, a differentiaion between control and content.

This can be used to mean one of the following:

- access to name records, subject to a formal registrar of ICAHNN (as typically used) (requires permanent transfer)
- access to digital property associated to domain (similar to copyright license)
- (both) access to control and access to source

For example, use domain https://twitter.com/nfnth, upon transfer (of password), both control and content are transferred.

On the other hand, with base domains, ie. https://twitter.com, it's not as simple. Upon transfer (of registrar password), only control is transferred. 

The difference with base domains is that all content is subject to the intent of both parties involved...

Thus a need for *domain deed* to become the representation of both control and content, the said **source** of a digital property.

Dralun uses user groupings to differentiate, and domains can be permenently transferred, or temporarily licensed, depending on the need.

#### Civilian Class

|**Class** (*ability*)|*Control?*|*Content?*|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|**Civilian** (*vote*)|no|no|Vote|
|**Tenent** (*claim*)|no|yes|Tenent deeds (Domain licenses) must be renewed same as with domain registrations. |
|**Holder** (*hold*)|yes|no|Controller has control access, source content is not guaranteed.|
|**Owner** (*own*)|yes|yes|Owner has control access and rights to source content.<br/>Owner deeds (Domain transfers) are permanent and require only the one-time fee.|

**Control** = Access to name records, ie. A, AAAA, CNAME, etc.

**Content** = Access to source files, ie. profile, artifacts, etc.

### On Demand

**Dralun** is made on the proceeds from citizens.

Included in every Owner (or Tenant) Deed is the **NfNth** survival bag.

For further inspiration, read our manifest, the [Civilian's Complex](https://github.com/nfnth/nfnth/blob/master/doc/CC.md).

Also, available for [purchase]() as Founder's Edition (or Standard Edition).

#### Explore Further

Use the [UR.Land](https://ur.land) map to visit a continent filled with amazing peoples and lands. 

To achieve dominion, take the following steps:

- Create the ultimate profile
- Control territory, write a land treaty, share strategy
- View real-time stats on the [UStat.us](https://ustat.us) dashboard

And that's it! May a nomad wander until what is lost is found.

### On Development

**Dralun** is built on brOS, a light-weight, open-source stack, to host our platforms using [Linode](https://cloud.linode.com/linodes) and [GitHub]().
