### [Dralun](https://dralun.com), Land of Deed to Domain

Explore **Dralun**, a deed-driven world where domains are built using artifacts etched in code, and land holders can both pass or preserve their domains.

Deeds, include:

- Land domains
- the tribes of Dralun
- other peoples and objects
Nomad and Civilian deeds are domain non-specific and are used to extend UR.Land functionality,

To begin, create an OpenSea account, or browse the world with **Nomad** status.

### On Deed to Domain

**Dralun** is the concept of *domain deed*, a differentiaion between control and content.

This can be used to mean one of the following:

- access to name records, subject to a formal registrar of ICAHNN (as typically used) (requires permanent transfer)
- access to digital property associated to domain (similar to copyright license)
- (both) access to control and access to source

For example, use domain https://twitter.com/nfnth, upon transfer (of password), both control and content are transferred.

On the other hand, with base domains, ie. https://twitter.com, it's not as simple. Upon transfer (of registrar password), only control is transferred. 

The difference with base domains is that all content is subject to the intent of both parties involved...

Thus a need for *domain deed* to become the representation of both control and content, the said **source** of a digital property.

Dralun uses classes to differentiate, and domains can be permenently transferred, depending on the need.

#### Domain Class

|**Class** (*ability*)|*Control?*|*Content?*|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|**Civilian** (*vote*)|no|no|Vote|
|**Tenent** (*claim*)|no|yes|Tenent deeds (Domain licenses) must be renewed same as with domain registrations. |
|**Holder** (*hold*)|yes|no|Controller has control access, source content is not guaranteed.|
|**Owner** (*own*)|yes|yes|Owner has control access and rights to source content.<br/>Owner deeds (Domain transfers) are permanent and require only the one-time fee.|

**Control** = Access to name records, ie. A, AAAA, CNAME, etc.

**Content** = Access to source files, ie. profile, artifacts, etc.

### On Demand

For further inspiration, read our manifest, the [Civilian's Complex](https://github.com/nfnth/nfnth/blob/master/doc/CC.md).

#### Explore Further

Use the [UR.Land](https://ur.land) map to visit a continent filled with amazing peoples and lands. 

To achieve dominion, take the following steps:

- Create the ultimate profile
- Control territory, write a land treaty, share strategy
- View real-time stats on the [UStat.us](https://ustat.us) dashboard

And that's it! May the nomad wander until what he's lost is found.

### On Development

**Dralun** is built using brOS, a light-weight, open-source stack, to host our platforms using [Linode](https://cloud.linode.com/linodes) and [GitHub]().
