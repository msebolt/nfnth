### On Deed to Domain

Explore [UR.Land](https://ur.land), the [Land of Dralun](https://dralun.com), inspired by the legendary sword of [Durendal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durendal), an **Ethereum-driven** world designed to revolve around the concept of *deeds*, *domains*, and *artifacts*.

**Dralun** is based on the concept of a **domain deed**, defined as an **NFT** used to provide ownership and access to a *domain*, including the ability to create *artifacts*. Upon transfer of **domain deed**, all said ownership, access, and artifacts, are transferred to whomever owns the **NFT**.  

Example **domain deeds** include,

- [Lands](), e.g. [acebasin.us]()
- [People](), [tribes](), e.g. [arikawa.us]()
- [Machines](), [relics](), e.g. [zanos.us]()

Additional **NFTs** available include, 

- [Time-locked objects](), e.g. the [Gunslinger]()
- [Artwork](), e.g. [Chimi mascot]()

To begin, [visit us on OpenSea](https://opensea.io), or [wander the world](https://dralun.com) as **Nomad**.

Please note that access to [UR.Land]() requires [MetaMask]().

### On Domains and Artifacts

[Dralun](https://dralun.com) uses the concept of the **domain deed**, the control over both the access and content, to allow,

- access to domain properties
- access to domain artifacts (both *public* and *private*)
- ability to create, edit, and share artifacts (both *public* and *private*)

If the **domain deed** (**NFT**) is transferred, the previous owner will lose all rights previous granted. 

#### Domain Features

- rights to access and modify domain
- NFT properties, 
  - stock image
  - map icon and placement
  - links to historical record

All domain holders get a custom NFT minted as record in the deed transfer registry. 

##### Limited Availability

The primary set of **domain deeds** listed on [UR.Land](https://ur.land) is limited to 1776 in the spirit of *.us* and to preserve fair trade value. 

An additional 776 **domain deeds** are reserved as limited edition to celebrate [Roland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland), in honor of [dralun]().

Time-locked objects and standard art-based are excluded from these limitations. 

#### Domain Types and Labels

Types and labels are used to differentiate and classify all domains. 

|**Type**|Categories|Description|
|-|-|-|
|**Person**|historical, tribe||
|**Place**|land, town, mountain, river, island, monument||
|**Thing**|ancient, machine||
|**Object**|||
|**Artwork**|||

Deeds also use labels to denote properties such as state, serial, and informational links.

#### Artifacts

Artifacts are records (text, image/file, location) posted to a domain. 

Public artifacts can be viewed by everyone, private artifacts can only be viewed by the domain holder or with key. 

Use the [editor]() for an example. 

Domain space is limited to 1GB (*subject to change*).
