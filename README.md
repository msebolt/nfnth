The land of **Dralun**, inspired by the legendary sword of [Durendal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durendal), is an Ethereum-powered world that revolves around *deeds* and *artifacts*.

Use NFTs to provide ownership (and access) to build your domain and create artifacts to share with others. 

Transfer NFTs to give both access and control over your domains (and artifacts) to other people.

### On Deed to Domain

**Dralun** uses the concept of *domain deed*, control over both the access and content .

Use of the domain deed (NFT) for the following:

- access to domain properties
- access to domain artifacts (both public and private)
- ability to create and share new artifacts (both public and private)

Dralun uses labels to differentiate and classify all domains. The current set of domains is limited to 1776 with 776 reserved as limited edition. 

#### Domain Types

|**Type**|Categories|Description|
|-|-|-|
|**Person**|historical, tribe||
|**Place**|land, town, mountain, river, island, monument||
|**Thing**|ancient, machine||
|**Object**|||
|**Artwork**|||

Deeds can also carry special labels to denote properties such as state, serial, and informational links.

Follow in the footsteps of [Roland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland) to achieve dominion,

- Store and collect artifacts to showcase (or keep private and share with key)
- Create the ultimate profile with links to your personal site
- View real-time stats on the [UStat.us](https://ustat.us) dashboard

And that's it! May the nomad wander until what he's lost is found.
