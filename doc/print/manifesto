A Civilian's Complex

An exercise in armchair centrism and the use of a personal tactician.

To understand the tacit needs and concerns of middle-class comfort, so as an average citizen can create monsters at will, it is these demons that also must be vanquished.

To present itself as a need of self-propagation and infinitive-basis so that in the utopian watchmaker's workshop we can begin to build and destroy such things.

To know yet unfortunately, that despite such grand endeavors, the limitation of time is always present.

*utilitarian...
To understand time, consider these three (3) principles:

**Tortoise** and **Hare**, one moves *slow* and reflective, the other moves *fast* without thought

**Chronos** and **Kairos**, the ancient Greek's two distinctions,

    - Chronos, as numeric or chronological, time as a *quantitative* force

    - Kairos, as the right or opportune moment, used in metaphysical or Divine time, as a *qualitative* force

**Janus**, the Roman, double faced towards both *future* and *past*

Taken as one, time becomes a steady stream to which we are given mere "drops" so that we can observe the basic structure of things and not be overwhelmed by the details.

### On State and Process in Non-Death Scenarios (Current State)

You must work to avoid pitfalls by challenging your instincts and training them with constructive plans, a classic representation of our struggles.

|Self, plan, people, ability to empower|[spec] - "power" (good to get lost)|
|Task, stock/supply, item/tool, transport|[build] - "raid" (expand territory)|
|Cash/papers, property, market, utility|[resource] - "establishment" (build base)|
|Desert mentality, sustainable boat cabin|[relic] - "world citizenship" (consume)|

### Use the remarkable routine to maximize quandrants

1. awake to noise with natural light in cozy den
    - do chores (household order, diner) for exercise
    - clean as you go
1. take shower in hot springs with hygiene
    - dress/style in clean linens with an agenda
    - map (unfamiliar) territory with laid out as paths
    - chart a course/campaign, script day with tasks/events/deliverables...
1. have coffee and movable snack
    - open shop, discuss specs (we'll eat first, then go), commute by drive or passenger, make observations on the environment, run errands/stocks/shipments
1. meet not for fun, but business, adversaries and islands (with whales)
    - two shelters in position, both shaky, raid them and take fire
    - fun and games said officer, we saw your smoke, what have you been doing? having a war or something?
    - on friendship, let's have a fort
    - people haul rocks up a mountain, each move on in a different way
1. get home and sit on floor with back against wall
    - eat dinner, watch old shows with chess/cards, music/news, relax, read by a fire, work late with classical music, study with homework/reading/writing/drawing
1. rest and wash up, drink water, medicine, then sleep
    - midnight snack of milk and apple), no Stress

### "worker" dirty habits vs. "king" technology scenario

#### Case example: Huff Parker (asleep)

Suffering from the prisoner's dilemna, a person is alone and confused now fallen into a state of continual discomfort. For example, he wakes up in a cave of darkness. Damn, he mutters checking the time. He was running late and was already lost in the memories of last night's dream. The thoughts of work encroach upon his mind and for a moment he tells himself one more minute of rest until his phone awakens. Damn, he said again and so it was. Lying in a messy bedroom, unshowered/unshaved, only looking forward to his stash of drugs and a smoke with Mr. Pibbles and his clan of cats, now oblvious to the light outside.

- ("overinflated bloat") madness, confusion, details, so many goddamn details, scattered thoughts like papers, try to grab as many as you can, random universe, forget something and go back to get it, you're going off course into dead time where you see things you normally wouldn't, things as they are without you there
- ("pure primalcy") Need to defeat my colossi, catch the millennium to save myself, past/present/true/false matrix as lie detector, dark tower as mountain top? something to waste away on, the "kings" I pay homage to...

*electrician...
#### Case example: Max Hamish (awake)

beer/bread Tartoogas revival with picnics, renditions of American classics with exotic cash crops (peppers/willow/mint/gum), menu abstract simple vs. detailed

- "crafted" snacks to feasts (cooked beef stew, fried chicken/potato salad/bread/cheese/brownies, crackers, meat, spices, knoephla bacon) fry/spice meat, (potato)salad/bread/cheese/brownies/soup/crackers
- jelly jar drink alchemy tonic/elixir (water, coffee, tea, vitamins, shakes, wine, spirits, sparkling juice), screen shock headache powder
