### On Deed to Domain

Welcome to **ocur.io Â· Ocurios**, a world inspired by the geocacher's trade and powered by **deed** and **domain**.

In **Ocurios**, use an NFT as both,


- **deed**, the *token* to store in an *Ethereum-enabled* wallet to share/trade with others
- **domain**, the *key* to access a domain and build its content


Domain content, called **artifact**, can include anything from datetime, location, and text, to images and files, to associate with the domain.

Upon transfer of an NFT *deed domain*, both **domain access** and **domain content** are transfered to the new owner.
<br/><br/>
### Get Started

To begin, install a *web3-compliant* Ethereum wallet, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and/or [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet), and visit [OpenSea <i class="material-icons">sailing</i>](https://opensea.io/urland) to purchase an NFT.

Next, use the <i class="material-icons">account_balance_wallet</i> icon to connect and to view your **deed domain** and build content.
