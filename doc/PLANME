### On Deed to Domain

Welcome to **ocur.io Â· Ocurios**, a world inspired by the geocacher's trade and powered by **deed** and **domain**.

In **Ocurios**, an NFT is used as *deed domain*, as,


- **deed**, a *token* to store in an *Ethereum-enabled* wallet to share/trade with others
- **domain**, a *key* to access a domain and post content


Posts can include information like datetime, location, text, and images and files, to be associated with the domain.

Upon transfer of an NFT (*deed domain*), both **access to the domain** and **all domain posts** are transfered to the new owner.
<br/><br/>
### Get Started

To begin, install a *web3-compliant* Ethereum wallet, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and/or [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet), and visit [OpenSea <i class="material-icons">sailing</i>](https://opensea.io/urland) to purchase an NFT.

Use the <i class="material-icons">account_balance_wallet</i> icon to connect and select your purchased **deed domain** to make a post.
