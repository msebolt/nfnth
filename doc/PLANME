### On Deed to Domain

Welcome to **ocur.io Â· Ocurios**, a world inspired by the geocacher's trade, powered by **deed domain**.

A *deed domain* is both,


- **deed**, a *token* to store in an *Ethereum-enabled* wallet and share/trade with others
- **domain**, a *key* to access a domain and build content


Content, also called **artifact**, can include datetime, location, and additional text, images, and files, to associate with the domain.

Upon transfer of a *deed domain* to another wallet, both *access* and *content* are also transfered to the new owner.
<br/><br/>
### Get Started

To begin, install a *web3-compliant* wallet, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and/or [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet), and visit [OpenSea <i class="material-icons">sailing</i>](https://opensea.io/urland) to purchase an NFT.

Then, use the <i class="material-icons">account_balance_wallet</i> icon to connect and to view your **deed domain** and build content.
