### On Deed to Domain

Welcome to **ocur.io Â· Ocurios**, a world inspired by the geocacher's trade, powered by **deed domain**.

Use a **deed domain** as both,


- *deed*, token to store in an *Ethereum-enabled* wallet to share/trade with others
- *domain*, key to access a domain and build content


Content, referred to as **artifact**, can include datetime, location, and additional text, images, and files, to be associated with the domain.

Upon transfer of a **deed domain** to another wallet, both *access* and *content* are transfered to the new owner.
<br/><br/>
### Get Started

To begin, install a *web3-compliant* wallet, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and/or [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet), visit [OpenSea <i class="material-icons">sailing</i>](https://opensea.io/urland) to purchase an NFT, then use the <i class="material-icons">account_balance_wallet</i> icon to connect and select your **deed domain** to build content.
