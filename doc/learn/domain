### Build Domain

Post content to build your domain in ocur.io. Domain posts can only be created/edited/deleted by the owner of the **domain**.


Posted content is attached to a domain and can consist of text, images, location, and datetimes.
<br/><br/>
All posted content is public and can be viewed by anyone.


<br/><br/>
If an **NFT** is transferred to another wallet, both access to the domain and all the domain's content are transferred to the new owner.
