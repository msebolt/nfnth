### About Domain

Domains grant ownership and access to create artifacts in UR.Land. They also generate **UR** to increase your profile's visibility and list artifacts on Registry.

To purchase a domain, go to [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/urland) and purchase a NFT.

After purchase, revisit [UR.Land](https://ur.land) and select the <i class="material-icons">account_balance_wallet</i>  icon in the upper-right.



<br/><br/>
If the **NFT** is transferred to another wallet, domain access, generated **UR**, and all the domain's artifact are transferred to the new owner.
