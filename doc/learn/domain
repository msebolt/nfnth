### About Domain

Domains grant ownership and access to create artifacts in UR.Land. They also generate **OCUR** to increase your domain's content visibility in the Deed Registry.

To purchase a domain, go to [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/urland) and purchase a NFT.

After purchase, revisit [ocur.io](https://ur.land) and select the <i class="material-icons">account_balance_wallet</i>  icon in the upper-right.



<br/><br/>
If an **NFT** is transferred to another wallet, access to the domain, generated **UR**, and all the domain's content are transferred to the new owner.
