### On Deed to Domain

Welcome to **NfNth**, a world inspired by the geocacher's trade, powered by the **NFT deed domain**.

Use **NFT deed domain** as both,


- *deed* - token to store in a crypto wallet, to share/trade with others
- *domain* - key to access a domain and build content


Content, also called **artifact**, includes datetime, location, additional text, and images and files, to be associated with the domain.

Upon transfer of a **deed domain** to another wallet, both *access* and *content* are transfered to the new owner.
<br/><br/>
### Get Started

To begin, install a *web3-compliant* wallet, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and/or [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet), visit [OpenSea <i class="material-icons">sailing</i>](https://opensea.io/nfnth) to purchase an NFT, then use the <i class="material-icons">account_balance_wallet</i> icon to connect and select a **domain** to build content.

*Use of nfnth.com requires a web3.js-compliant wallet, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download) and/or [CoinBase](https://wallet.coinbase.com/) to access a domain and build artifact.*

### Build Domain


Post content to build your domain. Posted content can consist of text, images, location, and datetimes.
<br/><br/>
Domain posts can only be added/edited/deleted by the owner of the NFT **deed domain**.

All posted content is public and can be viewed by anyone.

<br/>
Please note if the **NFT** is transferred to another wallet, both domain access and domain content are transferred to the new owner.
