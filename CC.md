The tacit understanding of the needs and concerns of middle-class comfort.

As the poet creates monsters at will, these demons must be vanquished. It is the need of self-propagation and infinitive-basis and a utopian watchmaker's workshop to build and destroy such things. 

And despite these endeavors, the limitation of time is always present. To understand, consider (3) principles:

1. The tortoise and hare, one moves slow and reflective, the other fast from one place to another.

1. The ancient Greek's two distinctions, that of Chronos and Kairos.

    - Chronos, refers to numeric, or chronological, time as a quantitative force.

    - Kairos, refers to literally "the right or opportune moment", used to metaphysical or Divine time, a qualitative force.

1. The Roman deity Janus, double faced towards both future and past.

Taken together time becomes a steady stream to which we are given mere "drops" so that we can observe the basic structure of things and not be overwhelmed by the details.

train to avoid pitfalls by challenging your instincts and training them with constructive plans, a classic representation of our struggles.

### State and Process in Non-Death Scenario (Current State)
      
Laws of Governance [order]: past/present/true/false (suit quadrant?)

- Self, plan, people, ability to empower [spec] - "power" (good to get lost)
- Task, stock/supply, item/tool, transport [build] - "raid" (expand territory)
- Cash/papers, property, market, utility [resource] - "establishment" (build base)
- Desert mentality, sustainable boat cabin [relic] - "world citizenship" (consume)

### the remarkable routine to maximize quandrants

1. awake to noise with natural light in cozy den, do chores (household order, diner) for exercise, clean as you go
1. take shower in hot springs with hygiene, dress/style in clean linens with an agenda, map (unfamiliar) territory with laid out as paths, chart a course/campaign, script day with tasks/events/deliverables...
1. have coffee and movable snack, open shop, discuss specs (we'll eat first, then go), commute by drive or passenger, make observations on the environment, run errands/stocks/shipments
1. meet not for fun, but business, adversaries and islands (with whales), two shelters in position, both shaky, raid them and take fire, fun and games said officer, we saw your smoke, what have you been doing? having a war or something? on friendship, let's have a fort, people haul rocks up a mountain, each move on in a different way
1. get home and sit on floor with back against wall, eat dinner, watch old shows with chess/cards, music/news, relax, read by a fire, work late with classical music, study with homework/reading/writing/drawing
1. rest and wash up, drink water, medicine, then sleep (midnight snack of milk and apple), no Stress

### Case example: Huff Parker (asleep)

Suffering from the prisoner's dilemna, a person is alone and confused now fallen into a state of continual discomfort. For example, he wakes up in a cave of darkness. Damn, he mutters checking the time. He was running late and was already lost in the memories of last night's dream. The thoughts of work encroach upon his mind and for a moment he tells himself one more minute of rest until his phone awakens. Damn, he said again and so it was. Lying in a messy bedroom, unshowered/unshaved, only looking forward to his stash of drugs and a smoke with Mr. Pibbles and his clan of cats, now oblvious to the light outside.

"worker" dirty habits vs. "king" technology scenario

- ("overinflated bloat") madness, confusion, details, so many goddamn details, scattered thoughts like papers, try to grab as many as you can, random universe, forget something and go back to get it, you're going off course into dead time where you see things you normally wouldn't, things as they are without you there
- ("pure primalcy") Need to defeat my colossi, catch the millennium to save myself, past/present/true/false matrix as lie detector, dark tower as mountain top? something to waste away on, the "kings" I pay homage to... 

### Case example: Max Hamish (awake)

beer/bread Tartoogas revival with picnics, renditions of American classics with exotic cash crops (peppers/willow/mint/gum), menu abstract simple vs. detailed

- "crafted" snacks to feasts (cooked beef stew, fried chicken/potato salad/bread/cheese/brownies, crackers, meat, spices, knoephla bacon) fry/spice meat, (potato)salad/bread/cheese/brownies/soup/crackers
- jelly jar drink alchemy tonic/elixir (water, coffee, tea, vitamins, shakes, wine, spirits, sparkling juice)
